Building CRUDL with MVC 
    Books Shop (code  name: book-shop) 
    Code an app that shows a list of books: id, name, price, imgUrl.  
    We will allow the user – a shop owner – to manage the books. 

TODO:  

   
    2. Code the function renderBooks() that will render the books with table rows 
    <tr> and <th> and <td> 
    3. Use a book-service to manage the books (gBooks) 
    a. Use the localStorage to load and store books. 
    4. Now, let's handle CRUDL (Create, Read, Update, Delete and List) 
    a. Add an Actions column to the table  
    5. Delete - when the button Delete is clicked call onRemoveBook that will use 
    the service's function removeBook(bookId)) 
    6. Support adding a new book: 
    a. When clicked, call the function onAddBook() that will read (prompt) 
    the details from the user: name and price, then will call a function 
    addBook(name, price) that pushes a new book into the gBooks array.  
    b. Call the renderBooks() to redraw the table 
    7. Support updating a book: 
    a. When clicked, call the function: 
    onUpdateBook (bookId) that will prompt for the book new price and 
    call the service's function updateBook(bookId, bookPrice). 
    Then Call the renderBooks() to redraw the table 
    8. When user removes or saves a book, show success messages  
    9. Use a modal to show all the details of a selected book  
    a. When read is clicked, show the modal with details of the selected 
    book.
